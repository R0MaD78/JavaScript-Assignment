				<h4>Stan Lee was an American comic-book writer, editor, and publisher,<br/>
				who was executive vice president and publisher of Marvel Comics.</h4>
				<p class="f_letter">Stan was born in New York City, to Celia (Solomon) and Jack Lieber, a dress cutter. His parents were Romanian Jewish immigrants.<br/>
				He challenged the comics' industry's censorship organization, the Comics Code Authority, indirectly leading to it updating its policies.</p><br/>
				<h4>Characters co-created by Stan Lee</h4>
				<ol> 	<!-- centered list on different color font/background -->
					<li>Spider-Man </li>
					<li>the Hulk </li>

					<li>Iron Man </li>
					<li>Daredevil </li>
					<li>Thor </li>

				</ol>
				<p class="f_letter">Lee subsequently led the expansion of Marvel Comics from a small division of a publishing house to a large multimedia corporation.<br/>
				He had cameo appearances in many Marvel film and television projects, with many yet to come, posthumously.<br/>
				A few of these appearances are self-aware and sometimes reference Lee's involvement in the creation of certain characters.<br/>
				On 16 July 2017, Lee was named a Disney Legend, a hall of fame program that recognizes individuals who have made an extraordinary and integral contribution to The Walt Disney Company.<br/>
				Stan was married to Joan Lee for almost 70 years, until her death. The couple had two children.<br/>
				Joan died on July 6, 2017. Stan died on November 12, 2018, in LA.</p><br/>
